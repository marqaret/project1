I try to do sth special in this repo ;)

Hi! I just come back from the Git website!

At first, I had a little problem with pushing my file on the website. Finally, I found out that I have to add '-f' before 'origin' in 'git push origin master' if this is my first pushing.
And now it works! :)
Enjoy,
xoxo
